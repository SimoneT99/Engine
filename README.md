A custom game engine designed with these principles in mind:
- Fast response time of the player input
- Higly parallel to maximize multi-threaded machines
- Graphic pipeline indipendent: the idea is to allow programmers to develop their render pipeline if they want to do so

The project is a passion project and learning tool so do not threat this as a flashed out engine.
