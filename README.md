A custom game engine designed with these principles in mind:
- **Highly parallel**: Optimized to maximize performance on multi-threaded machines.
- **Graphics pipeline independent**: Programmers can develop their own rendering pipelines if desired.
- **Programmer-friendly**: Designed to be easy for developers to work with (specific details to be determined).
- **Modular architecture**: The engine is being developed with modularity in mind, allowing each core component to be rewritten if needed. The default implementations will likely be fine-tuned for a specific style (yet to be decided).

This project is a passion project and a learning tool, so it should not be considered a fully fleshed-out engine.
